# TechnoHacks-Project
Data Cleaning:
This project uses the titanic dataset fron kaggle. The data has a column 'Survived' with its value as '0' or '1' for surviving and not surviving passengers respectively.
In the project, exploratory data analysis is done using matplotlib, seaborn and numpy. Data visulatization techniques such as heatmap, countplot and distplot have been used to analyse the missing data.
Data Cleaning is then performed using data imputation technique. The imputation method used depends on the results of exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
For categorical column, dummy variable technique is employed using pandas.
Thus, the data is prepared for further data analysis.
